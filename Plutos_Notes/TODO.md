# TODO: Pluto's Notes Enhancements

## Phase 1: Essential Features (Estimated: 2â€“3 weeks)
### Goals:
1. **Historical Copy of All Notes**
   - Maintain a separate log (e.g., in `localStorage` or a JSON file) to track every note, even after it's deleted or updated.
   - Include a "View History" button to review archived notes.

2. **Timestamps**
   - Add timestamps to each note when created.
   - Show timestamps in the visible list.
   - When a checkbox is ticked, timestamp the completion and move the item to an "Archived" or "Completed Notes" section.

3. **Checkmark Boxes for Items**
   - Add checkbox functionality for items within a note.
   - Completed items should move to a historical list or become invisible automatically.

4. **User Feedback**
   - Update button labels dynamically (e.g., "Update Note" when editing).
   - Add simple visual feedback like alerts or color changes for successful actions.

## Phase 2: Intermediate Features (Estimated: 3â€“5 weeks)
### Goals:
1. **Prioritization System**
   - Allow users to assign priorities (e.g., High, Medium, Low) to notes.
   - Sort notes by priority (default) or creation date.
   - Add color-coding for easy visualization (e.g., red for high priority, yellow for medium, green for low).

2. **Titles and Tags**
   - Add a field for note titles.
   - Introduce tags for categorization (e.g., Work, Personal).
   - Include tags in search and filtering.

3. **Action Section**
   - Add an action section to each note for extra details (e.g., parts ordered, follow-up steps).
   - Save these details alongside the main note.

4. **Split Tasks by Date**
   - Enable splitting tasks into manageable time frames (e.g., Today, This Week, Later).
   - Show these sections visually in the notes container.

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Estimated: 4â€“6 weeks)
### Goals:
1. **Search and Filter**
   - Add a search bar to find notes or tasks by keyword, tag, or date.
   - Include filters for viewing notes by priority, date, or completion status.

2. **Drag-and-Drop**
   - Implement drag-and-drop functionality for manual reordering of notes.

3. **User Interface Improvements**
   - Add a compact or expanded view option for notes.
   - Enhance responsiveness for mobile or smaller screens.

4. **Backups and Data Export**
   - Provide an option to back up all notes to a file (e.g., JSON or CSV).
   - Allow users to import notes from a backup.

### Learning Goals
1. **JavaScript Fundamentals**
   - Practice using arrays, objects, and localStorage for dynamic data management.
   - Understand DOM manipulation for creating, updating, and deleting notes.

2. **CSS for Visual Feedback**
   - Learn basic styling for themes, priority color codes, and user feedback (e.g., hover effects).

3. **Version Control**
   - Use Git and commit frequently to save progress.
   - Tag major milestones with version numbers (e.g., v1.0.0 for initial release).

4. **Break Tasks into Smaller Pieces**
   - Work on one feature at a time.
   - Test each feature thoroughly before moving to the next.

### Suggested Timeline
1. **Weeks 1â€“2**: Complete Phase 1
   - Focus on historical copies, timestamps, checkboxes, and basic user feedback.

2. **Weeks 3â€“5**: Complete Phase 2
   - Add prioritization, titles/tags, and the action section.
   - Work on splitting tasks by dates.

3. **Weeks 6â€“8**: Complete Phase 3
   - Implement search, drag-and-drop, and UI improvements.
   - Add backup and import/export functionality.

### Notes
- This project is for personal learning and use, so take your time and enjoy the process!
- If you get stuck, ask for help, look up resources, or experiment to figure things out.
- Start simple and iterateâ€”each step is a building block for the next.
